# Watermelon-Detection

This project introduces a new method for detecting watermelon in farmland. This method is based on traditional image processing method and proposed a new approach to the problem. The algorithm is having a high accuracy and a low complexity, which greatly benefits the autonomous harvesting process in the farmland.\\

This project is written in matlab.
